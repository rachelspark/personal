    <p>Iâ€™m a student at Stanford working on the future of cloud computing at <a href="https://modal.com/">Modal</a>.</p>
    <p>I like building products that help people create, collaborate, and learn. Previously, I straddled product growth and engineering at <a href="https://www.warp.dev/">Warp</a> and <a href="https://get.mem.ai/"> Mem</a>. I also started Curieus. </p>
    <p>I'm a fan of being outdoors, coffee, memoirs, and volleyball.</p>
